## Abstract

This project presents an **automated UI and functional testing framework** for the web-based system  
**SwiftTranslator (Singlish → Sinhala)** using **Node.js** and **Playwright**.

The primary objective is to evaluate:
- Functional correctness of Singlish-to-Sinhala conversion
- Stability of the user interface under varied input conditions
- System behavior for both valid and invalid user inputs

Backend APIs, performance testing, and security testing are **not included** in the scope of this study.

## 1. Introduction

Modern web-based language processing systems require reliable validation to ensure usability and correctness.
This project applies **end-to-end browser automation** using Playwright to test the SwiftTranslator user interface
under real user interaction scenarios.

Automated testing improves repeatability, accuracy, and efficiency compared to manual testing.

## 3. Test Scope

### 3.1 In-Scope
- Singlish to Sinhala text conversion
- UI responsiveness and stability
- Positive and negative input handling
- Real-time output updates

### 3.2 Out-of-Scope
- Backend API testing
- Performance and load testing
- Security and penetration testing

## 4. Prerequisites

The following software must be installed before running the tests:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

Verification:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

7. Test Case Design

The test suite includes:

7.1 Positive Functional Test Cases

  ▪ Daily conversation sentences

  ▪ Questions and commands

  ▪ Past, present, and future tense

  ▪ Mixed English and Singlish input

7.2 Negative Functional Test Cases

  ▪ Typographical errors

  ▪ Slang-heavy input

  ▪ Random symbols and punctuation

  ▪ Long unstructured text

  ▪ Multi-line inputs

7.3 UI Test Case

  ▪ Verification of real-time Sinhala output update

9. Results and Observations

  ▪ The system successfully processes standard Singlish inputs.

  ▪ Negative inputs do not crash the application.

  ▪ Output is generated in all tested scenarios.

  ▪ UI remains responsive under different input formats.

10. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Playwright-based UI automation
for validating web-based language translation systems.
The test framework ensures consistent quality validation and can be extended
for future enhancements.
